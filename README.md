<h3>🏠 <b>Homepage</b>: <a href="https://yixuanhuang04.github.io" target="_blank">yixuanhuang04.github.io</a></h3>
<p>
I am a final-year undergraduate student majoring in Electronic Information Engineering at [Wuhan University of Technology](http://english.whut.edu.cn/).  
I am currently working with Prof. [Jingjin Yu](https://arc-l.github.io/) on multi-robot task planning, focusing on decision-making and planning in complex, shared environments.

Previously, I was fortunate to work as a research assistant at the Shanghai Artificial Intelligence Research Institute with Dr. Tianrui Shen, where I conducted applied robotics research spanning computer vision, robotic manipulation, and 3D reconstruction.  
I have also been involved in academic research at Huazhong University of Science and Technology under Prof. [Guohui Li](https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Li-Guohui-4), with an emphasis on robotics and multi-modal learning, and at Wuhan University under Prof. Min Peng, focusing on computer vision and image recognition.

My research interests center on robotics, with an emphasis on motion and task planning in complex, open environments.  
Through my research experiences, I have come to believe that meaningful robot autonomy requires bridging classical planning and optimization methods with learning-based approaches, grounded in physical interaction with the real world.  
I am particularly interested in developing hybrid planning frameworks that combine the strong feasibility, safety, and efficiency guarantees of classical methods with the adaptability of learning-based models under sensing noise, model mismatch, and environmental uncertainty, with the goal of improving the robustness, reliability, and interpretability of robotic decision-making systems for safer and more practical real-world deployment.

In the long term, I aim to contribute to embodied intelligence by developing robots that can generalize from limited supervision and adapt to novel tasks and environments.  
I am always open to research collaborations and research-oriented opportunities in robotics and artificial intelligence.
