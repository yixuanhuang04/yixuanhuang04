<p>
Hello! My name is <b>Yixuan Huang (Chinese name: ÈªÑ‰∫¶ËΩ©)</b>, and I am currently a third-year undergraduate student at <a href="https://www.whut.edu.cn/" target="_blank">Wuhan University of Technology</a>, majoring in <b>Electronic Information Engineering</b>. I am deeply passionate about <b>robotics</b> and <b>artificial intelligence</b>, with a particular focus on how robotic agents can <b>perceive, reason, and interact with the physical world in a human-like and reliable manner</b>.

Broadly, my interests lie in enabling robots to <b>autonomously acquire skills</b> through interaction with their environments and through <b>collaboration with humans</b>. My research focuses on improving the <b>robustness, reliability, and safety</b> of robot behaviors in real-world settings‚Äîchallenges that are fundamental for the effective deployment of robotic systems. These capabilities are crucial for applications such as <b>household service robots</b> and <b>logistics manipulators</b>.

In addition, I am interested in <b>navigation and decision-making in dynamic and uncertain environments</b>, which plays a critical role in empowering robots to move intelligently and interact seamlessly within both <b>physical</b> and <b>human-centered spaces</b>. Practical applications include <b>autonomous driving</b> and <b>mobile robotics</b>.

My long-term goal is to contribute to the advancement of <b>embodied intelligence</b> and the understanding of <b>physical interaction</b>, enabling robots to <b>generalize from limited supervision</b> and <b>adapt to novel tasks and environments</b>.

<i style="color: red; display: inline;">I am currently seeking <b>research internship opportunities</b>. If you are recruiting a research assistant or intern, please feel free to contact me at <i>[yixuanhuang2004@gmail.com](mailto:yixuanhuang2004@gmail.com)</i>. I would be delighted to explore potential opportunities for collaboration.</i>
